# Assignment 01 — SMS Spam Classification

## Objective
Build a prototype for SMS spam classification using machine learning.

## Dataset
SMS Spam Collection dataset containing labeled messages as spam or ham.

## Workflow
1. Data preparation
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Preprocessing
4. Model training
5. Model evaluation
6. Error analysis

## Models Used
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Character N-gram Logistic Regression

## Evaluation Metrics
Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

## Best Model
(Log this after running notebook)

## Files
- prepare.ipynb → data loading and preprocessing
- train.ipynb → model training and evaluation
- train.csv, validation.csv, test.csv → dataset splits
- models/ → saved trained model

## How to Run
1. Run prepare.ipynb
2. Run train.ipynb
3. Best model saved in models/
